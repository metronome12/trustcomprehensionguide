    title: Express Trust vs. Corporation
    description: TBD
---
FIRST, I must clarify that though I am referring primarily to corporations, included in the reference are all organizations which owe their existence to legislative acts, not limited to Limited Liability Companies, Limited Partnerships, Agencies, Co-Partnerships, etc., which, though not classified as corporations, avail themselves of benefits, privileges, and franchises of the state for their very creation and existence. 
Second, since we have already shown the distinct juridical personality of the trust as a legal entity,99 we will not reexamine it until we consider its personality under the Roman civil law of the 14th Amendment in a later section. But it must be noted the well settled law that the Express Trust is a lawful,100 legal, valid business organization,101 possessed of the right to hold property and sue in its business name.102 And its uses in modern business have some of their strongest roots in England, Germany and many of the United States where it has been recognized for its superiority, and even praised by such notable authorities as the Ohio Supreme Court for its effectiveness in the business of life insurance.103 
The declaration of trust has been held to be an effective substitute for incorporation, for its many advantages, which will undoubtedly shine though to the reader by the following table. I have prepared this table based upon the work by John H. Sears who, after discussing the impact of the twin landmark cases104 on the grave lack of profitability of using corporations for, inter alia, dealing in real estate, went to task in outlining the distinct benefits of Express Trusts, and the works by William C. Dunn,105 Guy A. Thompson,106 and Sidney R. Wrightington.107 Mr. Sears says:108

> The decision of the United States Supreme Court . . . holding that **the [Express] Trusts are not subject to the Federal excise tax on corporations**, has emphasized this method of conducting business as compared with corporations. . . **[T]he best legal talent was soon impressed into the service of devising a means of affording the usual advantages belonging to a corporation without the authority of any legislative act**. A method of placing the property into the hands of trustees, who held the legal title and issued certificates, similar to shares of stock, to the cestui que trust, showing the interest owned by each, possessed nearly all the advantages desired. [This excluded the use of limited liability companies, joint-stock associations, and co-partnerships, which are] **organized under enabling statutes** which [merely] enlarge the privileges possessed at common law, and they are, therefore, subject to State regulations, which may be equally burdensome to those imposed on corporations. [Italics emphasis supplied in original; bold emphasis and bracket information added.] 

* Preliminary note: While the mortality rate of corporations and the like have historically remained high, Express Trusts remained, and indeed to this day, continue to remain vital.109 But, again, the table will show you why.

- Express Trust {% align="center" %}{% width="50%" %}
- Corporation {% align="center" %}{% width="50%" %}

---
- Life-span of 20-25 years at a time, in order to avoid rule against perpetuities. Death of grantor has no effect on life or affairs of trust.{% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
- Perpetual or certain number of years, in most cases legislative requirements govern.{% align="center" %}{% width="50%" %}{% vertical="top" %}
--- 
- Governed under equity. Trust law is most well-settled body of law in America. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}  
- Governed under statute. Forever subject to burdens of inquisitorial legislation. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
---
- Limited liability of trustee determined by trust instrument. In any given contract, only property in hands of trustee is answerable. Remember Boyd 
and Silverthorne—Not subject to subpoena. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
- Corporate officers personally liable for all ambiguous indorsements. Remember Enron and Global Crossing—Must answer in legislative court for all acts.110 {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
---
- Business name protected by injunction. (May use trade-name or trademark for legitimate purposes.)111 {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
- Must apply for and secure fictitious firm name, and must register all trade-names and trademarks {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
---
- Trust is Article IV § 2 citizen of the United States via its trustee, not a 14th Amendment citizen, unless trust contracts under the amendment.112 This citizen is understood in constitutional law as the private citizen.113 {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
- Corporation is 14th Amendment citizen,114 regardless of citizenship of corporate officer. Generally state corporations require officers to be citizens as well. This citizen is inherently public due to the nature of the amendment.115 {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
---
- Not required to obtain business license. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
- The opposite is the case. 116 {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
---
- Trustees issue certificates in the manner prescribed by trust instrument. Certificate holders cannot transfer without approval of Board of Trustees. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
- Must go “public” in order to issue stock. Stockholders may dispose of shares of stock, but corporation and stockholder alike are taxed indirectly in more ways than one can count. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
---
- May bring and defend litigation in trust name and entity, or in trustee name. Same rules as to parties and procedure at law and in equity are applicable. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
- May bring and defend litigation in the corporate name and entity only. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
---
- Trustees afforded more leverage, and powers are generally more broad than corporation, as it may provide for whatever any individual may do. The sky (nature) is the limit. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
- Relatively broad powers, as in the example of holding companies. But corporation may not do whatever any individual may do. The statute (legislature) is the limit. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
---
- All Federal excise tax and state organization and franchise taxes are avoided. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
- The opposite is the case, except for state taxes in certain states. In either respect, all corporations are taxed indirectly via inflation.117 {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
---
- Trustees are not required to file reports with any authority, and are accountable only to beneficiary, governed strictly under principles of equity. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
- Required to file reports, quarterly, etc. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
---
- Not subject to foreign corporation laws of any state. Not inherently subject to commercial regulation, but for income derived from corporate stock and physical franchises under Article I § 8 Clauses 1 and 3. Express Trust is valid in all States of the Union.118 {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
- Inherently subject to all foreign corporation laws and commercial (public policy) regulation. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
---
- No legal obligation to maintain the capital and refrain from paying dividends out of capital. Trust instrument governs. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
- The opposite is the case. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
---
- Units of beneficial and capital interest in trust are not personal property of holder, and give holder no control over the administration or _res_ of the trust. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
- Shares of stock are personal property in hands of owner, and taxes issue on same property against corporation and then against the stock-owner. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
---
- Trustees have absolute-rights and privileges to engage in interstate commerce under protection of the Federal Constitution.119 {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
- Corporate officers have relative-right and privileges to do so, and incur more taxability by doing so. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
---
- Trustee(s) have exclusive management, except where Managing Agents are contracted, or a Board of Directors is elected. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
- Board of Directors are managers with limited, defined powers to conduct business, hold regular meetings, etc. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
---
- Interests of the beneficiary(s) well protected by courts of equity. Power to secure information as to the actions of the trustees and status of trust fund is, no doubt, superior to the rights and remedies of stockholders in corporation. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
- Protected by the basic impersonal nature of corporations, yet corporate veil is regularly pierced.120 The elite attorneys are well aware of this. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
---
- Dissolution or changes may be effected without formality. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}
- The opposite is the case. {% align="center" %} {% width="50%" %}

These advantages and more have been and are still seized by some of the shrewdest, wealthiest individuals and families in America and from abroad. But the widely perceived, yet absolutely untraceable, wealth of such individuals and families like the Rothchilds, Rockerfellers, Kennedys, Forbes, and many of the American founding fathers, plus countless modern day politicians, are strong circumstantial evidence of this. One may find many articles and information, as well as quotes,121 attesting this. 

Given the private nature of the Express Trust, there is virtually no lawful method by which to pierce the trust without the express permission or implied consent of the parties, or some unlawful activity on the part of the trust giving rise to a bona fide cause of action. As a result, virtually no direct evidence of the trust’s existence can be found unless it is made to be found—and even then it can only be heard by a court of competent jurisdiction, which, as you shall see in the sections ahead, is very hard to find nowadays. This is protection at its finest, hiding in plain sight, so to speak; and it is well understood by the powerful elite that “bene vixit, qui bene latuit.”122 In many ways, the common law itself, with its precious substance, is hiding in plain sight (or is well hidden, depending on the perspective).

100The lawfulness of the Express Trust is obvious, however, the allegation to the contrary has often been made in the past, and is occasionally made by the ignorant nowadays. Among the long list of precedents confirming its lawfulness is Palmer et al. v. Taylor et al., 269 S.W. 996 (1925), offered here simply to add to the collection. 

101See Baker v. Stern, A.L.R. 462; Reeves v. Powell, 267 S.W. 328 (1924); Weeks v. Sibley, 269 Fed. 155 (D.C.Tex. 1920); Phillips v. Blatchford, 137 Mass. 510 (1884); and Burnett v. Smith, supra. 

102See U.S. v. Carruthers, 219 F.2d 21 (C.A.9 (Or.) 1955). 

103“There was no class of business, the transaction of which, as a matter of private right, was better recognized at common law than that of making contracts of insurance upon the lives of individuals.” State v. Ackerman, 51 Ohio St. 163, 37 N.E. 828, 24 L.R.A. 298.

109See Chandler, supra at p. 11. The reportedly oldest Express Trust in America is the North American Land Company, formed by Patrick Henry, with the aid of John Nicholson and James Greenleaf, for Robert Morris of Virginia (popularly known as the “Financier of the American Revolution,” distinguished from Virginia Colony Governor Robert Morris), circa 1764, roughly a decade prior to the signing of the Declaration of Independence (1776) and Mr. Henry’s compelling address to the Virginia Legislature, Give Me Liberty (1775). North American Land Company was later expanded in 1795, but was dissolved in 1798, at which time its land holdings consisted of roughly 4 million acres scattered over Georgia, the Carolinas, New York, and the states in between. See Plan of Association of the North American Land Company: Established February 1795 by Peter Force (1795). 
Another, and possibly more noteworthy, Express Trust was the Merchants Bank of New York, formed by Alexander Hamilton, circa 1810. As an aside, this Express Trust made full use of transferability of shares, i.e., certificates, and limited liability (see Hamilton’s Works, Congressional ed., VII, 838), whereas Mr. Morris ultimately served time in debtor’s prison after the trust revenues from installment sales and share sales did not come in quickly enough to meet the loan and tax deadlines. George Washington is reported to have had many a dinner in debtor’s prison with Mr. Morris, where he visited him frequently—the two were good friends.

110Although corporate officers reserve the “right” to “plead the fifth,” they have merely the relative-right to plead the congressionally interpreted “spirit” of the amendment, not the letter of the law, due to their 14th Amendment citizenship. Trustees of an Express Trust have the absolute-right to refuse self-incrimination. See Lee Brobst et al., supra; Boyd v. U.S., supra; and Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. U.S., supra. 

111See People v. Rose, 219 Ill. 46, 76 N.E. 42; YWCA v. YWCA, 194 Ill. 194, 62 N.E. 551; McLean v. Fleming, 96 U.S. 245 (1877); Lane v. Brothers, etc., 120 Ga. 355; Aiello v. Montecalfe, 21 R.I. 496; and Rudolph v. Southern Beneficial League, 23 Abott’s N.C. 199. 

112See Farmers Loan & Trust Co. v. C. &. A. Ry. Co., 27 Fed. 146 (C.C.Ind. 1886); and Shirk v. City of LaFayette, 52 Fed. 857 (CC.Ind. 1892). For an understanding of the profound superiority of Article IV § 2 citizenship over 14th Amendment citizenship, see Lee Brobst et al., supra.

113See Hale v. Henkel, supra. 

114See Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific R. Co., supra. 

11514th Amendment citizens, under the Roman civil law (private international law/admiralty-maritime law), are inherently public, with only relative-privacy. 

116See People v. Rose, supra. Once trust is executed, it is an existing “express business,” and, unless the trust instrument requires the trustee to obtain a business license, one is not needed except for new (i.e., heretofore nonexistent) express business. 

117“[I]nflation is a ‘method of taxation’ which the government uses to ‘secure the command over real resources, resources just as real as those obtained by [ordinary] taxation’. ‘What is raised by printing notes,’ . . . is just as much taken from the public as is . . . an income tax.’”1980 Annual Report, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, p. 10, quoting John Maynard Keynes’ The Economic Consequences of the Peace. 

118See Jones v. Habersham, 107 U.S. 174, 27 L.Ed. 401 (1883); Fellows v. Miner, 119 Mass. 541; Sohier v. Burr, 127 Mass. 221; Sewall v. Wilmer, 132 Mass. 131; and Cross v. U.S. Trust Co., 131 N.Y. 330, 349, 30 N.E. 125. A trust invalid where created, but valid where to be administered will be upheld where made. Hope v. Brewer, 136 N.Y. 126, 143, 32 N.E. 558. 
119Any statute enacted by a state which prohibits this right is in conflict with the Constitution. See Bruant v. Richardson, 126 Ind. 145, 25 N.E. 807; Robey v. Smith, Ind.Sup. 30 N.E. 1093; and Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co., supra.

120Collections attorneys know this very well. All one need do is look no further than the Global Crossing or Enron scandals to see how every corporate veil is able to be pierced when the effort is backed with enough incentive. And when it’s pierced, who bites the bigger bullet(s)? Stockholders—they have no real recourse but to cry in public. 

121One such quote is that of John D. Rockerfeller who is reported to have said that the key to true wealth and power is to “own nothing and control everything.” Your author is confident that the reader will see the self-evidence of this truth; and the Express Trust throughout the relatively short history of America has served to facilitate this practice. A search for the assets of the Rockerfeller family will prove the truth of this philosophy.
