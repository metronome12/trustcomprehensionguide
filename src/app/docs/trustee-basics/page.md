FIRST AND FOREMOST, any person (man, sovereign, trust, corporation, etc.) capable of taking legal title to property can be a trustee.[^52] And there is no limit to the number of trustees who may serve on any one trust. Generally, where there are more than one trustee, the trustees, with respect to each other, are referred to as co-trustees,[^53] and when acting jointly as a collective body are referred to as the Board of Trustees. 

Furthermore, there is no law prescribing the character of a trustee, and while it has been held that a trust cannot be invalidated simply due to the incompetence of the trustee, the trustee should be a person capable and fit for executing the powers and duties honorably.[^54] (This is the basis for the general rule that beneficiaries are not desirable as trustees, though there is no law to forbid such appointment. Equity will generally avoid all temptation to a breach of trust.) The trustee should have his residence within the jurisdiction of the court of equity in which the estate is located, if indeed the trust corpus is an estate. But where the trust corpus is portable land, the trustee need not be resident within any single jurisdiction, which non-residency will not disqualify or preclude the trustee from carrying out his position.[^55] 

As far as accepting the appointment is concerned, acceptance should be made formally, expressly in writing, though it will always be implied “if the individual intermeddles with the trust property, or performs any act to carry out the trust.”[^56] Once the acceptance has been tendered, no court of equity can prevent the trustee from holding that office, except for breach of trust[^57] or good cause dependent upon the merits of that particular case.[^58] Removal must be procured pursuant to the provisions of the declaration, or, where no such provisions are made, by decree of a court of equity. 

But the office of trustee is not always a desirable one when the trust instrument conveys an unreasonable obligation. (Again, this is where careful attention to detail is most crucial in preparing the trust instrument.) The trustee has a duty of care toward the beneficiary(s), and must harbor no biases in administration. The best rule is that the trustee should be given enough discretion to carry out his position to the best of his ability and responsible creativity. To put it plainly, the settlor must trust the trustee to carry out his duties, and use his powers justly.

[^53] This term is sometimes used to denote that the co-trustee has less authority than the trustee. In that sense, the co-trustee is called a passive trustee, and the trustee an active trustee. But Express Trusts usually employ the term co-trustee simply to denote that there are several trustees of that trust. 

[^54] supra. Beach describes this concept as “in such a manner as to subserve the interests of the beneficiary[.]”

[^57] See In re Tempest, (L.R. 1 Ch. 487), 31, 1431: Lord Justice Turner settled the rule of law that “[f]irst the court will have regard to the wishes of the persons by whom the trust has been created, if expressed in the instrument creating the trust, or clearly to be collected from it. . . . If the author of the trust has in terms declared . . . a particular person . . . [t]he court in those cases conforms to the wishes of the [creator].” A Breach of Trust does not include a technical breach of trust, e.g., one made through mistake.

[^58] See Loring, supra at § 8, p. 19. The reasons are generally for guilt of willful breach of trust, waste or mismanagement of trust property, refusal to account to beneficiary, lunacy, drunkenness, bad habits or carelessness which endangers the trust property, or improvidence.
