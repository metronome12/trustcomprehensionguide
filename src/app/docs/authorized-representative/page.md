AS SHOWN ABOVE, it is well within the power, discretion, and often times duty (trust instrument notwithstanding), to contract an Authorized Representative or Managing Agent to deal with certain affairs of the trust. And the basic rule which courts of equity have laid down is that a trustee may contract an agent to handle all affairs which require no discretion, be they ministerial or not, and he may not delegate the essential part of a power given to the agent (unless, of course, permitted by trust instrument).95 
In clarifying the discretionary power rule, it must be noted that there is no law against delegating discretionary powers to agents. The rule is simply that a trustee who does so, “does so at his own peril,”96 for he is liable for all resulting losses, if any. To clarify what constitutes the essential and unessential parts of a power, the essential part is defined as “the exercise of . . . discretion . . . , the [determining of] need[s] of [the trust], or the appropriateness of [an action].” The unessential part is that “not requiring the exercise of discretion.” However, there is a simple solution, allowing for greater flexibility in this rule, which is to “authorize the agent to contract subject to the assent of the trustee.”97 And if the trust instrument makes provisions for the contracting of an Authorized Representative or Managing Agent, then the trustee cannot be liable for his acts. 
Now, the method for contracting an Authorized Representative may be either by formal appointment, execution of a limited power of attorney, letter of authorization, or even verbal authorization (preferably documented by minutes). The most effective, secure method of contracting such an agent would obviously be an actual appointment with written contract setting forth the specific powers authorized, terms of the arrangement, extent to which the liability of the agent shall be limited by the trustee, etc. But, a letter of introduction is, for most purposes, sufficient.98 This is the case with all individuals and organizations, however constituted.

98I have supplied the reader with a sample multipurpose letter of introduction and letter of authorization for opening a bank account in the sample forms section. All the reader need do is modify the letter to encompass the particular purpose for which the authorization may be necessary. A sample limited power of attorney is also provided in that section. I have also provided a sample Authorized Representative contract (which can be used for Managing Agents as well), specifying the particular authorization, power, and limitation of liability, etc., for said agent. (When used with Managing Agents, modification to the contract’s language may be necessary.)
