    title: Priviledges & Liabilities of the Trustee
    description: TBD
---
IN ADDITION to the powers and duties of trustees, there are certain privileges (including allowances), rights and liabilities of the trustee. These are all those which are enumerated in the trust instrument and naturally extended to the trustee of an Express Trust. As was noted before, certain restrictions placed upon trustees of ordinary trusts do not apply to the trustee of an Express Trust pursuant to the doctrine of greater latitude.74 These, aside from those allowed by the trust instrument, include, but are not limited to— 
* The inherent, unquestionable right to full compensation, including reimbursement of all out-of-pocket and other expenses incurred in the discharge of duties. (And unduly withheld reimbursement results in a lien on the trust for the amount plus interest);75 
* The privilege of residing in the trust estate and allowance of rates and taxes “although he has the benefit of residing in the house”;76 
The right to employ a solicitor77 for assistance and guidance in the administration of the trust, and, in the case of any doubt or difficulty, to seek the opinion of competent counsel, and, in the case where the trust’s accounts are intricate and complicated, to seek the assistance of an accountant—all to the charge of the trust; 
* The right to apply to a court of equity for directions in the execution of the trust, or to obtain a declaratory judgment in order to establish the meaning and intent of the trust instrument;78 
* The right to carry on in separate business for the benefit of the trust given certain conditions; 
* The allowance of remuneration for loss of time under certain circumstances; * The right not to be compelled by subpoena or review to produce and show records or books to outside parties;79 
* The right to further limit his liability in particular contracts, even beyond the limitation made in the trust instrument, i.e., by operation of law; 
* The right to relocate, move trust property, or change the trust’s domicile;80 and * The inalienable right to disclaim the office at the execution, or resign at a later date. 
With regard to the personal liabilities of a trustee, they encompass what the trustee is and is not liable for. Basically, the inherent liabilities (and non-liabilities) are all those incident to ownership at law81 and imposed or exempted under contract law, for it is a maxim of law that “le contrat fait la loi.”82 (I will show in a later section the several methods for limiting one’s liability completely, regardless of how un-limitable the following may seem, but for now we will entertain the basic liabilities saving those methods for later.) These include, but are not limited to— 
* Liability on all contracts made, whether signing as “trustee” or signing individually;83 
 Liability of removal for breach of trust, waste, mismanagement, or good cause shown in an action for removal in a court of equity,84 or according to trust instrument; * Liability for losses sustained by the trust as a result of negligence;85 * Liability for torts and common-law criminal and civil wrongs;86 
* Liability in all cases of co-mingling of trust funds;87 and 
* Liability for all mischief of his agents contracted to exercise discretionary powers.88 
But, the trustee is not at all liable for any losses sustained in the proper discharge of their duties,89 and, with the case of other losses due to negligence or tort, the trustee may be able to be bonded in the manner ordinarily used by trustees, executors and administrators. Nor, are they liable for— 
* Contracts in which liability was properly limited (by the methods to be shown later). Such contracts may also encompass the codes and statutes of various jurisdictions, given that all manmade law is, by its nature, fundamentally contractual; 
* The debts of the trust incurred requiring the creditor to look solely to the trust for payment90 (and the trust is not liable for the personal debts of the trustee,91 except to the extent of attachability of the trustee’s interest in the trust92); 
* The independent, non-preventable acts of co-trustees, of which he had no prior knowledge;93 
* The acts of his agents when properly contracted; 
* Taxes on income of the trust;94 and 
* Lawsuits against the trust.

74See Ashworth v. Hagan Estates, supra. 
75James Hill supra at pt. IV, div. II, ch. IV, pp. 570-571. “Such is the rule of courts of equity, and such also is the rule at common law.” Quoting Lord Cottenham in the case of Att.-Gen. v. Mayor of Norwich, 2 M. & Cr. 406, 424. Also see Rex v. Inhabitants of Essex, 4 T.R. 591; and Rex v. Commissioners of Sewers, 1 B. & Adolph 232. 76Id. “However a trustee who employs a park-keeper, or other servant, for his own purposes, must pay him himself, and will not be allowed his wages out of the estate. And so a trustee, with the most ample powers of management, cannot of his own authority keep up a mere pleasurable establishment, such as gamekeepers, &c.” 77This is defined as “[a] person who conducts matters on another’s behalf; an agent or representative.” Black’s Law Dictionary, p. 1399 (7th ed. 1999). 
78See Dunbar v. Redfield, 7 Cal.2d 515. 
79See Boyd v. U.S., supra; and Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. U.S., supra. 
80See Beach, vol. I, supra at § 19, p. 28; Rice v. Houston, 80 U.S. 66 (1871); Fost. Fed. Pr. Sec. 19; and Story, Fed. Pr. Sec. 19. Also, in New Orleans v. Whitney, 138 U.S. 595, 34 L.Ed. 1102 (1891) the court said “[w]e have repeatedly held that representatives may stand upon their own citizenship in the federal courts irrespective of the citizenship of the persons whom they represent—such as executors, administrators, guardians, trustees, receivers, [etc.]” 
81See Loring, supra at pt. II, § 1, p. 23. 
82“The contract makes the law.” See Bouvier’s Law Dictionary, pp. 770-790 (1928). The basic principle is that all man’s law is contractual in nature, regardless of the particular classification of the law, and can acquire force only by consent: “Consensus facit legem.” 
83See Loring, supra at pt. II, § 3, p. 65. Simply using the title “trustee” will not sufficiently limit liability. That without express stipulation (such as that which I have provided in the later section) he is personally bound is well-settled law. See Feldman v. Preston, 194 Mich. 352, 160 N.W. 655; Bried v. Mintrup, 203 Mo.App. 567, 219 S.W. 703; Hussey v. Arnold, supra; Carr v. Leahy, 217 Mass. 438, 105 N.E. 445; and also Knipp v. Bagby, 126 Md. 461, 95 A. 60. 
84Any such action would have to be instituted by an interest-holder, as a last resort. And the burden of proof rests with the party bringing the action.
85See Holmes v. McDonald, 226 Ill. 169, 80 N.E. 714; and Norling v. Allee, 10 N.Y.Sup. 97. But it must also be noted that this, as with all of the others can be limited. In Fisheries Co. v. McCoy, 202 S.W. 343 it was held that it is lawful for liability to be limited in certain cases of tort and negligence, except where the relation of master-servant or passenger-carrier exists. 
86See Loring, supra at § 1, p. 26. However, in torts and civil wrongs, limitation of liability is amply available as per Fisheries Co., supra. But, as it is with corporations, common-law crimes are strictly of an in personam nature, going against the officer personally. 
87Generally, in cases of co-mingling of the trustee’s personal funds with trust funds, courts will follow the trust property, unless co-mingled beyond separation, in which case the courts will treat the trust as the alter-ego of the individual acting under the assumed title of “trustee,” and will ignore the trust arrangement completely. See Gregory v. Helvering, 293 U.S. 465 (1935), XIV-1 C.B. 193; and Helvering v. Clifford, 309 U.S. 331 (1940). Mixing trust property with personal property is co-mingling. See Perry on Trusts, vol. I, ch. XV, § 447 (6th ed.). 
88See Beach, vol. II supra at ch. XXV, § 548, p. 1243; and Winthrop v. Att.-Gen., 128 Mass. 258. 89Equity will always follow the law. And the trustees can never be penalized for properly discharging their duties. 90See Taylor v. Mayo, 110 U.S. 330, 4 S.Ct. 147, 28 L.Ed. 163 (1884); and Frost v. Thompson, 219 Mass. 360, 106 N.E. 1009. 
91See Wright v. Franklin Bank, 59 Ohio 80, 51 N.E. 876. 
92See Loring, supra at pt. II, § 1, p. 41; Mavo vs. Moritz, supra; and Hussey v. Arnold, 70 N.E. 87 (1904). 93See James Hill, supra at pt. III, div. I, ch. I, p. 309. If the acts were indeed preventable, and he had prior knowledge, then the trustee is co-liable and accountable for the loss. Also see In re Adams’ Estate, 221 Pa. 77, 70 A. 436; and In re Cozzens’ Estate, 15 N.Y.Sup. 771. 
94Again, the trustee must be indemnified by the trust instrument from taxation for trust gains. If the trustee holds interest in the trust, he is taxable only at the realization of an actual gain, not at the point of investment (see Burnet v. Logan, supra; and Trenton Cotton Oil Co. v. Commissioner, supra).
