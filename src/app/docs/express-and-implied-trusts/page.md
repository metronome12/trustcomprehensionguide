    description: The various types of trusts.

Without getting into the various subclasses of express and implied trusts, the basic difference between one created by express act of a party and one created by implied act of a party is that the former is stated fully in language (oral or written), while the latter is inferred from the conduct of the parties. These are very generalized definitions so presented for want of space, since there are many intricacies concerning the true meaning of the term that, in a sense, the classification of “express” trust can only be applied based on what is “implied” by the language of the instrument giving rise to the trust.)4 So, we won’t get into that. Our focus is on a particular written express trust type, and even though the above definition is essentially accurate, it does little to define the Express Trust as it is known in its fullest sense under the protections of the common law.
