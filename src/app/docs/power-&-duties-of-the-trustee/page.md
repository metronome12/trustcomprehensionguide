    title: Power & Duties of the Trustee
    description: TBD
---
THE POWERS of a trustee are divided into general, special and discretionary ones. The general are all those inherent in trustees virtute officii, i.e., conferred by law; the special are all those conferred by the trust instrument; and the discretionary are all those arising out of necessity of personal judgment by way of circumstance (though ample discretion may also be conferred by law and under the trust instrument).59 

Moreover, it is well-settled law that under a declaration of trust, the trustees have all the powers necessary to carry out the obligation of that private contract which they have assumed.60 Furthermore, it is settled that the trustees of an Express Trust are afforded greater latitude of power and activities than ordinary trustees.61 The trustees are empowered to control every aspect of the trust according to the trust instrument and equity, and retain the power to eject even the beneficiary(s) from the premises.62 These powers include, but are in no way limited to— 

* The power to bind the trust in a contract, especially where such obligation is implied-by-law,63 and the power to contract with the beneficiary(s). 
The power to partition, exchange, sell, pledge or mortgage the trust property, either in whole or in part;64 
* The power to lease trust property;65 
* The power to issue, change, or otherwise dispose of securities of the trust; * The power to support the beneficiary(s) in all reasonable manner; * The power to prosecute and defend in the trust’s name or trustee’s name; * The power to make gifts out of trust property; 
* The power to delegate all unessential powers and duties; and 
* The power to exercise personal judgment and every discretionary power not prohibited by the trust instrument,66 and, as already shown, to do whatever is allowed to persons as a natural right. 
The fundamental principle of law is that for every power there is a correlative duty. The trustee, as a fiduciary to the beneficiary(s), assumes certain basic duties outside of the management of trust property, and certain duties aside from whatever specific duties may be conferred upon the trustee in the trust instrument. These duties include, but are not limited to— 
* The duty to support the beneficiary(s) in any essential needs which it may have, out the funds which would otherwise be paid to it in distribution. And if such funds are not available, the duty to accumulate any balance needed;67 
* The duty to refrain from taking advantage of peculiar knowledge or position when dealing directly with the beneficiary(s); 
* The duty to exercise the utmost good faith in all concerns of the trust, whether dealing with the trust property itself, or directly with the beneficiary(s) in matters concerning the trust,68 including to care for, protect and secure the trust property; 
* The duty to preserve, protect and further the trust’s interests, including pressing all reasonable demands and prosecuting and fending off all claims, and claiming all available exceptions and taking all available advantages in such matters; 
* When delegating unessential powers and duties, the duty to exercise at least a general supervision of the trust affairs, and to perform any ministerial acts which require the exercise of discretion or judgment;69 
* The duty to keep minutes, and separate accounts of the trust, even if kept in a book with other accounts, with minutes showing decisions and resolutions reached, and accounts showing the state of the trust and pertinent details of transactions (generally in the form of schedules of income received, income paid, additions to principal, deductions from principal, principal on hand, and changes in investment consisting of debtor and creditor sides);70 
* Upon acceptance of the trusteeship, the duty to accept the trust property and trust documents;71 
* When investing trust funds, the duty to invest them securely, “so that they shall be preserved intact for the remainderman,” and to invest productively, “so that they shall yield [at least] the current rate of interest to the life tenant”;72 and * The duty to concur with all co-trustees, except where authorized to act individually.73

64 See Loring, supra at pt. II, § 3, pp. 54-69. It should be noted that even though the trustee may have sold the entire trust estate, the trust is not necessarily terminated until all obligations of the trust arrangement have been fulfilled, especially the transferring of the proceeds to the interest-holder(s).
65 It is a general rule that the if the trustees lease property outside of the powers granted to them by the trust instrument, such an act will constitute breach of trust. Again, it all comes back to the design of the trust instrument. 66See James Hill, A Practical Treatise on the Law Relating to Trustees, their Powers, Duties, Privileges and Liabilities, pt. III, div. I, ch. II, § 3, pp. 471-495. 
67 See Loring, supra at pt. II, § 4, p. 69. “[The trustee’s] fealty is to the trust, and all his acts must be governed by strict loyalty to it and the interests of the beneficiaries; and any act which is not in the [best] interest of the beneficiaries is a breach of trust.” 
68 Id. at p. 72. 
69 See Perry on Trusts, supra at § 409, p. 49. It is completely lawful and equitable for a trustee to appoint an Authorized Representative to act as agent in collecting rents and dividends, keep books and minutes, and, in general, act for the trustee wherever there is a moral or legal necessity to employ such an agent. (Necessity may be determined to exist where the ordinarily prudent business man would employ an agent in his own affairs.) See Ex Parte Belchier, Amb. 219. 
70 This is not required, but the rule of thumb is that the more detail kept, the better the accounting. The trustee is accountable to the beneficiary(s), and the accounts must ultimately balance out in the end. And an account settled in a court of equity is final; it cannot be reopened except to correct a mistake or fraud, and its correctness cannot be questioned in a collateral proceeding in equity or in a court of law. See Stetson v. Bass, 9 Pick. 26, 29; Dodd v. Winship, 144 Mass. 461; Sever v. Russell, 4 Cush. 513; and Parcher v. Bussell, 11 Cush. 107.

72 Loring, supra at pt. II, § 4, p. 95. Generally, where it is impossible to comply with the investments required by the trust instrument, a trustee has recourse to apply to a court of equity for directions. See McIntire’s Adm’rs v. Zanesville, 17 Ohio St. 352. 
73 See James Hill, supra at pt. III, div. I, ch. I, § 1, pp. 305-309; Brown v. Donald, 216 S.W.2d 679 (1949); Meldon v. Devlin, 31 App.Div. 146, 53 N.Y.Sup. 172; Barroll v. Foreman, 88 Md. 188, 40 A. 883; and Appeal of Fesmire, 134 Pa. 67, 19 A. 592.
