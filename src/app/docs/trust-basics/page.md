FIRST, it must be understood that any trust, regardless of the many designations applied to them, is, in its most basic sense, “a property interest held by one person (the trustee) at the request of another (the settlor) for the benefit of a third party (the beneficiary).”[^3] The classification applied to a trust is based upon its mode of creation, in which it may be created either by act of a party (express or implied), or by act of the law (resulting or constructive). 

## Express and Implied Trusts

Without getting into the various subclasses of express and implied trusts, the basic difference between one created by express act of a party and one created by implied act of a party is that the former is stated fully in language (oral or written), while the latter is inferred from the conduct of the parties. These are very generalized definitions so presented for want of space, since there are many intricacies concerning the true meaning of the term that, in a sense, the classification of “express” trust can only be applied based on what is “implied” by the language of the instrument giving rise to the trust.)4 So, we won’t get into that. Our focus is on a particular written express trust type, and even though the above definition is essentially accurate, it does little to define the Express Trust as it is known in its fullest sense under the protections of the common law. 

[^3]: Black’s Law Dictionary, p. 1513 (7th ed. 1999). An even more basic definition is provided therein as “[t]he right, enforceable solely in equity, to the beneficial enjoyment of property to which another person holds the legal title[.]” There are many more sub-definitions, as well as expansions upon the nature of a trust relationship, being a fiduciary one, but we won’t get into them for want of space.
