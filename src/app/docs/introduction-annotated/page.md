THIS HANDBOOK is about the administration of Express Trusts created under the original American common law and functioning under the General Law-Merchant, i.e., the unique system of commerce in the American states, as it stands in twenty-first century America.

The material presented herein has been reduced from various sources which the reader is encouraged to examine for his own knowledge and further understanding. The material herein has been rendered into a concise handbook format, intended to allow the reader to refer to each section for guidance on decisions regarding the most pertinent aspects of the administration of an Express Trust. So, only secondary attention has been given to all other matters. 

All in all, the author’s objective by this handbook is to devise a simple guide, with clearly outlined methods and sample forms, for the effective handling of affairs of Express Trusts, while also showing the many options for growth and prosperity, and profound protections afforded by Express Trusts (when created and administered properly). This book is written in a somewhat unconventional manner in order to accommodate this objective. 

If the reader should find, after examining the sources, that this work has failed in its objective, then let it be attributed to a fault of the author, not to any supposed faultiness of the sources or the Express Trust itself, for it will be admitted by all honest and learned [^1] lawyers (as it once was when “lawyers” were, by definition, “[any] person learned in the law”[^2]) that the Express Trust, especially one created with proper care to its trust instrument, is a far superior method of carrying out any voluntary contractual organization between individuals sui juris. 

[^1] It was the strongly held belief of U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren E. Burger that seventy-five to ninety percent of all trial lawyers are either incompetent, dishonest, or both. See 102 Reports of the American Bar Association, 205-206 (1978).
